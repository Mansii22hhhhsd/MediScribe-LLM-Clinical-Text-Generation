# 🏥 MediScribe – LLM-Based Clinical Text Generation
### 🤖 AI-Powered Clinical Report Generation

`Python` `PyTorch` `Transformers` `NLP` `Healthcare AI`

---

## 📌 Overview

MediScribe is a transformer-based Generative AI system designed to automate clinical documentation.  
It converts structured patient findings into coherent, professionally formatted medical reports using Large Language Models (LLMs).

This project evaluates generative language models for healthcare documentation using NLP metrics.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Clinical documentation is time-consuming and repetitive. Healthcare professionals spend significant time drafting structured reports, increasing workload and inconsistencies.

An intelligent generative system is needed to produce structured, readable, and context-aware clinical reports.
